Peer Reviewed: Thao Vang
desktop: overall looks pretty good. a few minor details that can use a bit of a fix are having cards a bit closer to each other. also in the reserve a room section you can remove the padding to get ridd of the black next to the picture.
tablet: sections are responsive. the only thing I notice was the drop down for nav button is right next to logo so when you press it, it shoots across the screen.
mobile: pretty much same as tablet.
