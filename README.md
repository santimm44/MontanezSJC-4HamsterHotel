## No Figma as the assignment uses a prototype.

## Level 1: Challenge #4 - Hamster Hotel

## Peer Reviewed: Thao Vang

desktop: overall looks pretty good. a few minor details that can use a bit of a fix are having cards a bit closer to each other. also in the reserve a room section you can remove the padding to get ridd of the black next to the picture.
tablet: sections are responsive. the only thing I notice was the drop down for nav button is right next to logo so when you press it, it shoots across the screen.
mobile: pretty much same as tablet.

## In this project, you will take the following mockup and make it into a fully functioning website using bootstrap.

* This Project will be added to your Git Repository 
* This will need a peer review
* Grading will be based on how close your website is to the prototype.
* Also you must make the website responsive. 

**If your assignment arrives past the due date, it is destined for a zero.**
